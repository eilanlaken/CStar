Not really inheritance.
Just Partial Classes.
What does it mean? So:
An extended class has a copy of all the attributes of the base class.
Also, it has the copy of the methods. No overrides! @ implements is only for interfaces.

public partial class Shape extends Object is Transformed, Measured {

    private vector3 transform;

}

@implements
public function rotate(float angle) Shape shape {
    p.transform = rotate(p.transform)
}

public function print() Shape shape {
    print("I a am shape!");
}


public class Rectangle completes Shape {

    private float width, height;

}


public function print() Rectangle rectangle {

    print("I a am rectangle!");

}


States and objects?
Here:

// cannot be terminal
@states(off = 0, on = 1)
public class LightBulb {

}


// initialization
