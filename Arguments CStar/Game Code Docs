// new features:
entities
relations
databases

example:

public database cityDB {

    public relation father(Person x, Person y);
    public relation mother(Person x, Person y);
    public relation siblings(Person x, Person y);
    public relation enemies(Person x, Person y);
    public relation friends(Person x, Person y);
    public relation owes(Person x, Person y, int amount);

    private City city;

}

Can only extend abstract classes.

public base class A can be transformed {

}

public class B is A {

}

primitive classes are not extending Object.
primitive classes cannot be abstract (base). -> primitive classes cannot be extended.
primitive classes cannot implement interfaces.

public class B is Object {

}

public base class Object {

    Object[] observers;
    Object[] observes;

}
